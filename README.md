# Chatter
=====================

Chatter:copyright: is a minimalist chat environment that supports an arbitrary number of users at a given time. No login or username is required to enjoy this platform. We promise, this chatroom will never become subject to the annoying constraints of cersorship imposed by moderators or other methods.

### Features

> Choose a username at any time. Or don't, and enjoy the mystery of Anonymity. A notification will be sent out whenever you or anyone update their username.

> Ever wonder what colour you would be if you were to be a colour? Wonder no more; our trusted colour selector will just tell you as soon as your send a message. No annoying questionaire required, and you won't suffer the consequences of decision paralysis. As an added perk, this is also helpful in keeping track of your conversations, especially if more than one chatter takes advantage of the aforementioned Anonymity feature.
